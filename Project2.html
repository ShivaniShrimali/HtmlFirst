  <h2 >About Me</h2>
  <p class="per" >There are many people living in world having different personalities. This is the personality which makes everyone unique and different from others. We can never see two people of exactly same personality. It never changes and decided the quality of a person. I am taking the example of me. I am so special in this world and have unique personality than others. I am very responsible and sympathetic person. I always help others and try my best to solve their problems. I am self-centred woman have not have any enemy in this world.


    I always talk to others very happily with smiling face. I am a very simple student in my school and attend each class. I do my homework very well on daily basis and study well every day in the night till 10 pm and in the morning from 4 am. I always pay attention to my study and motivate my friends as well to focus on their study.</p>
<h2 >My Education</h2>
<p class="per" >Education is very important for all of us. Either you are a child or old, it can help you at any age. Education is a type of learning that can be achieved in your school as well as in the playground because we can learn from anywhere.

  Education can help you in many ways, as it can play a very important role in your overall development. The earnestness of your learning can also make you an all-rounder. It is not always necessary to be scientific to invent. Your knowledge and different perspectives can also make you do things in a different way.
  
  For example, it was Dr. Abdul Kalam’s way of thinking, that he imagined of a flying machine thorough a bird, discussed by his science teacher. Education helps us to broaden our imagination and promote our way of thinking.
  
  We should learn from others and develops our own thoughts and this is the correct way of learning. Every year, some sought of books are served in each class but some students understand the true essence of learning and perform in an extraordinary way. You will be told about the same football techniques every time, but some of us develop some special types and techniques and apply our imagination which leads them to success.</p>
<p class="per">It was John Amos Comenius known as the Father of Modern Education. He discussed various types and forms of education. According to him, education was not confined up to classrooms. He wrote on various education methods, theories, and systems. He believed in illusions as students cannot learn only by reading.

  Education also develops a sense of respect and articulation in their vocab and treats everyone with respect. However, a person can be educated, but if he does not respect others or follow certain rules of a particular place, he is called illiterate. Education develops a sense of responsibility and if you understand and apply them, only then your education has value.
  
  Very well said by Mr. Albert Einstein “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.” This clearly states that education is not only up to our class. Think and bring a change in humankind and make your education worth it.</p>  
<h2 >My Contect</h2>
<p class="per" >As we all know, a paragraph is a group of sentences that are connected and make absolute sense. While writing a long essay or letter, we break them into paragraphs for better understanding and to make a well-structured writing piece. Paragraph writing on any topic is not only about expressing your thoughts on the given topic, but it is also about framing ideas about the topic and making it convenient for the readers to follow it. In English paragraph writing, it is essential to focus on the writing style, i.e., the flow and connection between the sentences.

  Therefore, a paragraph must be written in simple language in order to avoid any interruption while reading. In order to write a paragraph on any topic, you can refer to the samples given below and write a paragraph without any hindrance.</p>
